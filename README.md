This Password Vault Will encrypt and secure your passwords.

Firstly this has very nice intro , it will display the Welcome message like when someone types it .

Note  : Kindly the create login_details.txt and server_details.sekret files and update the path in the script .

Functionality : 

For the first it will ask you to create userid and password for login in to the Vault . 

After Creating/Loging in to the vault .

It will display four options 

  1 ->  Add Password to Vault 
  2 ->  Get Password from Vault
